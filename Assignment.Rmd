## About Me

### Current lab: Nelson Lab
### Project focus: I will study runoff on the coral microbiome and metabolome, specfically in West Maui and possibly Guam. I also am aiding in the Donahue Lab nutrient experiment. 
### Why you chose this course: I wanted to learn new techniques about coral reef photogrametry that could be used in my future work with shifts in reefs that involce runoff. 
### What do you want to learn about the most in this course: I enter this class very open minded and hope to walk away with a better understanding of how others may approach certain coral related issues and to have an open dialogue about creative ways to approach my future research goals and objectives. 
### Your R experience: I have taken advanced statistics in R last fall and have been modeling and visualizing in R for the last 5 years. 
### Fun fact: I love cooking and eating new foods, so my girlfriend and I are cooking a meal from each country around the world (currently have about 12 done).
